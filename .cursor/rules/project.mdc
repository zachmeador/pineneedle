Design spec is stored in project root / DESIGN.md. 

## remembering the design

a succinct but complete DESIGN.md in the project root should always be maintained to reflect the app and serve as a starting point for understanding the codebase

## the user's philosophy

simple maintainable design is key. documentation should be complete but elegantly succinct.

## inspiration

guiding thoughts from the authoring user are in THOUGHTS.md

## requirements

- use python uv and its functions. `uv run` especially.
